# FORCE UDF

**User-Defined Functions for FORCE**

![FORCE Logo](/images/force-udf.png)

This repository collects *user-defined functions* (**UDF**) that can be plugged into [FORCE](https://github.com/davidfrantz/force).

**Everybody** is encouraged to push their UDFs to this repository, such that the community as a whole benefits and has access to a broad variety of workflows.

This extra step of publishing your workflow is a small step to overcome the ["*Valley of Death*"](https://twitter.com/gcamara/status/1127887595168514049) in Earth observation applications! Only a minimal documentation is needed, see [this example](https://github.com/davidfrantz/force-udf/blob/main/python/ard/medoid/readme.md).

Supported are UDFs written in **Python** (needs FORCE v. >= 3.7.0) and **R**  (needs FORCE v. >= 3.11.0).

Tutorials [here (Python)](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/udf_py.html) and [here (R).](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/udf_r.html).
