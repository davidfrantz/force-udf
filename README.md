# FORCE UDF

**User-Defined Functions for FORCE**

This repository collects *user-defined functions* (**UDF**) that can be plugged into [FORCE](https://github.com/davidfrantz/force) (needs FORCE v. 3.7, to be released soon).

Supported are Python UDFs.
Support for R UDFs is planned.

A tutorial is in preparation.
